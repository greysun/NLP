DeepDive is a system to extract value from dark data. Like dark matter, dark data is the great mass of data buried in text, tables, figures, and images, which lacks structure and so is essentially unprocessable by existing software. http://deepdive.stanford.edu/index.html https://github.com/HazyResearch/deepdive  https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/
